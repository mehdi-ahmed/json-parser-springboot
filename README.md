# Placeholder Service - POSTS

This is a service for a project I'm building similar to JsonPlaceholder Service.

## Getting Started

To run the project you will need docker desktop running. The `compose.yaml` file is processed by Spring Boot on
startup and automatically runs `docker compose up` for you.

- There is a test suite in `/src/test/java/`
- There are Swagger Docs at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
- You need to have docker installed and running on you machine.
